* (2024-11-26) We released our paper and dataset for reproducibility.
* (2025-03-13) We updated the dataset to include filtered functions that are marked as non-vulnerable.
* (2025-08-11) We enriched the dataset with additional metadata information.

## üìú Overview

CleanVul introduces VulSifter, an innovative methodology that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with heuristic to automatically detect vulnerability-fixing changes within vulnerability-fixing commits (VFCs). This approach has enabled us to create two high-quality datasets: the primary CleanVul dataset containing 8,203 functions with 90.6% correctness, and a more precise variant comprising 6,371 functions with 97.3% correctness. Both datasets demonstrate quality comparable to or exceeding established benchmarks such as SVEN (94.0%) and PrimeVul (86.0%).

Our approach addresses the significant noise (40-75%) in existing vulnerability datasets caused by indiscriminate labeling of all modifications in vulnerability-fixing commits as vulnerability-related.

### Vulnerability Fix Identification in VFC

* ‚ú® **LLM-Based Analysis**: Uses state-of-the-art LLMs to comprehend code semantics and contextual information for identifying genuine vulnerability fixes
* ‚ú® **Heuristic Enhancement**: Custom filtering rules to eliminate test-related changes
* ‚ú® **High Accuracy**: Achieves F1-score of 0.82 in identifying genuine vulnerability fixes

### Better Vulnerability Dataset

* ‚ú® **High Quality**: Maximal 97.3% correctness rate for identifying genuine vulnerability fixes, comparable to manually curated datasets
* ‚ú® **Scale**: Contains over 6,371 function pairs across multiple programming languages
* ‚ú® **Language Coverage**: Includes Java, Python, C, JavaScript, C#, and C++ code
* ‚ú® **Diverse Sources**: Derived from analysis of 5.3M commits across 127K GitHub repositories

### Dataset Statistics

The dataset provides different versions based on confidence thresholds:

| Threshold | With Heuristics | Without Heuristics | Correctness (With Heuristics) | Correctness (Without Heuristics) |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1         | 26,549          | 29,841             | 43.1%                         | 37.5%                            |
| 2         | 16,287          | 18,465             | 57.7%                         | 49.4%                            |
| 3         | 8,203           | 9,031              | 90.6%                         | 76.5%                            |
| 4         | 6,371           | 7,023              | 97.3%                         | 78.0%                            |

### Understanding Thresholds

The thresholds represent confidence levels in our VulSifter methodology:

* **Threshold 1**: Lowest confidence level, capturing the broadest set of potential vulnerability fixes but with the highest false positive rate (43.1% correctness with heuristics)
* **Threshold 2**: Moderate confidence level, offering a balance between dataset size and accuracy (57.7% correctness with heuristics)
* **Threshold 3**: High confidence level, recommended for most applications, providing excellent balance between dataset size and quality (90.6% correctness with heuristics)
* **Threshold 4**: Highest confidence level, prioritizing precision over recall, offering near-perfect correctness (97.3% with heuristics) but with a smaller dataset size

The "With Heuristics" versions apply additional filtering rules to remove test-related changes and other non-vulnerability modifications, resulting in significantly higher correctness rates compared to versions without these heuristics.
